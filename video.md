# Video

### [Video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)

The **HTML Video element** \(**`<video>`**\) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use `<video>` for audio content as well, but the [`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

```markup
<video width="320" height="240" controls autoplay>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <track src="sub.vtt" kind="subtitles">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
```
